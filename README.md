<h3>FoodDeeds is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that fights food insecurity by connecting food suppliers with those in need.</h3>

<p>Businesses with excess food ("suppliers") can post and edit donations available for pickup, and can take a picture using their camera or select an existing file from their device. Those in need ("recipients") can browse, filter, and reserve/cancel available donations. An interactive map helps them search for nearby donations. All users can go to My Account to view their information, make edits, and view order/giving history. Suppliers can see their contributions summarized in a chart report.</p>

## HIRE US!

<p>
        In this project, we tackled huge engineering challenges
        including learning new technologies, caching and offline rendering,
        managing complex data, promise-chaining, flexible and mobile-friendly
        design patterns, and more. In the process, we grew into capable, skilled developers, and learned to be responsible and collaborative team players!
